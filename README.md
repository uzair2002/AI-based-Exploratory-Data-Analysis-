# AI based Exploratory Data Analysis

> **Abstract** : In this study, we delve into the realm of music analysis using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to conduct an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Spotify's music dataset. By harnessing the power of AI algorithms, we aim to uncover hidden patterns, trends, and insights within the vast musical landscape of Spotify. This research focuses on employing advanced data mining and machine learning methods to extract valuable information from audio features, user behaviors, and song metadata. Through meticulous exploration and interpretation, our analysis sheds light on the intricate relationships between musical attributes and user preferences, offering a comprehensive perspective on the role of AI in understanding music consumption patterns.
